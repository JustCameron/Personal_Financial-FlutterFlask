Any issue at any steps, shout me.

Have the following installed and rdy:
    -pgAdmin 4
    -database created using  'SQL Shell (psql)' (open this application which is part of pgAdmin4)
        
        -think its gonna ask you to create a password for evertime you open the app...make it simple/memorable
        if not:-
        
        press enter until you see all these:
        Server [localhost]:
        Database [postgres]:
        Port [5432]:
        Username [postgres]:
        Password for user postgres:
        
        next steps are as follows:
            create user "pfinance";
            create database "pfinance";
            \password pfinance
            alter database pfinance owner to pfinance;

        copy paste each line above 1 by 1. Once u reach password jus name it 'pfinance' 
        thing when asked to enter password
